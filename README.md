# Build & Test the Code Locally

  **Requirements**

  ```
    Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/   |(And the package-manager pip)
    NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/     |(And the package-manager npm)
    Gulp  : npm install gulp --global
            npm install gulp
  ```

1) Clone the repository into a folder and open it with your editor/IDE of choice.
2) Create a folder 'scripts' in which you'll build the executable js-bundle from gulp.
3) To do so, simply run 'gulp' in the terminal, and the default task is executed, giving you 'bundle.js' in '/static/scripts/'.
4) All other settings are prepared in advance, so what remains is to load the extension manually into your browser.

5) Once you load the extension, go to the part of your toolbar where you access them and its icon will appear for you to click and access it.
